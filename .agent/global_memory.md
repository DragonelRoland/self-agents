# Vibecode SaaS - Global Memory

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Build vibecode as a SaaS and scale it to 50k MRR
- **Current State**: Very early stage with basic agent infrastructure
- **Timeline**: Aggressive scaling approach needed

## Key Insights from Analysis
- Project currently has minimal codebase (just agent tools)
- Need to define what "vibecode" actually is as a product
- Starting from scratch essentially - need full SaaS architecture
- 50k MRR target suggests enterprise/premium pricing model needed

## Technology Stack Decisions
- Node.js/TypeScript (evidenced by existing bun usage)
- Modern web frameworks for rapid development
- Cloud-first architecture for scalability

## Business Model Hypothesis
- B2B SaaS targeting developers/teams
- Subscription-based pricing
- Enterprise features for higher tiers
- Freemium model to drive adoption

## Success Metrics for 50k MRR
- Assuming $100/month average: 500 customers
- Assuming $500/month average: 100 customers  
- Assuming $1000/month average: 50 customers
- Mix likely needed across pricing tiers

## Next Steps
1. Define core product concept
2. Build MVP rapidly
3. Focus on market validation
4. Scale through product-market fit
