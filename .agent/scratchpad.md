# Scratchpad

## Quick Notes
- Starting with basic calculator functionality
- Will implement keyboard support after basic UI works
- Need to handle edge cases like division by zero
- Consider adding memory functions later if needed

## Technical Considerations
- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Implement proper error states
- Make sure calculator state is managed cleanly
- Add proper accessibility attributes

## Testing Notes
- Test all arithmetic operations
- Test edge cases (very large numbers, division by zero)
- Test UI interactions
- Test keyboard input
