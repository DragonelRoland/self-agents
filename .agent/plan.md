# Calculator App Development Plan

## Overview
Building a clean, elegant calculator app following KISS and DRY principles.

## Technology Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla for simplicity)
- Modern ES6+ features
- CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout
- Testing with Jest

## Architecture
- Single-page application
- Modular design with separate files for:
  - Calculator logic (calculator.js)
  - UI handling (ui.js)
  - Main application (main.js)
  - Styles (styles.css)

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
- Clear and clear entry functions
- Decimal point support
- Keyboard input support
- Responsive design
- Error handling

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for calculator logic
- Integration tests for UI interactions
- Edge case testing (division by zero, etc.)
